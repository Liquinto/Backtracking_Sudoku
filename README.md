# Backtracking_Sudoku

This is a sudoku solver that uses both backtracking, as backtracking with forward checking.
This assignment was made for the class Computationele Intelligentie at Utrecht University, for which the exact assignment has been uploaded as well.

The sudoku solver works with both backtracking and backtracking with forward checking.
To use the right format the sudoku has to be filled in as a long string, that can, but doesn't have to contain, spaces. Blank spaces should be represented by zero's.

Examples of inputs are:

Grid 01*:

0 0 3 0 2 0 6 0 0 9 0 0 3 0 5 0 0 1 0 0 1 8 0 6 4 0 0 0 0 8 1 0 2 9 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 7 0 8 2 0 0 0 0 2 6 0 9 5 0 0 8 0 0 2 0 3 0 0 9 0 0 5 0 1 0 3 0 0

The algorithm can be put up against one another, to look which one performs better. The backtracking algorithm is more a less a brute force way of solving the problem,
and thus should perform better in simple, less complex sudoku's. While the backtracking with forward checking is better in solving more complex numbers, and thus should
be faster in that regard. However with the added complexity of analyzing the sudoku, the forward checking algorith can be somewhat slower in the more easy sudoku's. However
since both the backtracking, and backtracking with forward checking solve the easy sudoku's in no time, the forward checking approach will be prefered since in the harder
sudoku's the difference in memmory and time only gets bigger and bigger

*note that Grid XX shouldn't be entered in the terminal, and only the strings of numbers should.
